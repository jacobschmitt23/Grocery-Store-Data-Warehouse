# Grocery-Store-Data-Warehouse
<h3>Project Description</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>This repository contains two key Jupyter notebooks designed to simulate, create, and manage a data warehouse for a fictional grocery store chain. These notebooks enable users to generate a realistic dataset of store transactions, confroms and cleanse data marts into a unified schema, and roll up transaction-level data to produce meaningful reports highlighting sales performance summaries, customer purchasing trends, and profit analyses. Some of these reports are including in the project.</li>

  <li>Run the <b>Tims-Store-DB-Creation.ipynb</b> notebook first to initialize the database schema and populate it with simulated data to be used in the main file</li>
  <li>Run the <b>Run the Data Warehouse Creation + Report Generation.ipynb</b> notebook to process the generated data, transform it into a warehouse format, and generate the desired reports</li>
  </ol>
